Mental health disorders pose a significant public health challenge worldwide, with early detection and intervention critical for effective management. However, existing methods for identifying individuals at risk often rely on subjective assessments or occur only after symptoms have escalated. This project addresses this gap by leveraging machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for mental health disorders. By analyzing diverse datasets encompassing behavioral patterns, social interactions, and physiological indicators, our aim is to provide a proactive approach to mental health care, enabling early identification and intervention for individuals experiencing or at risk of mental health issues.
